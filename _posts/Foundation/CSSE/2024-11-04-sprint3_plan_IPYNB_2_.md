## Final Intro

Teacher and peer evaluation are critical to our success and improvements.

Be sure to support each meeting's objectives by performing self-reviews, providing feedback to peers, and acting on the feedback received from teachers and peers. The best way to support dialogue in our environment is to provide a Review Ticket (GitHub Issues and/or GitHub Pages Utterance).

1. **Individual Issues**:
   - It is required to build an issue and/or blog that describes your personal journey in all sprints.
   - By the end of this period, you should have personal issues/blogs related to Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Sprint 3.

2. **Teaching/Lesson Issue(s)/Blog**:
   - To collaborate effectively, there should be issue(s) assigned to you from the team.
   - This issue should show preparation, teaching, and grading.

3. **Homeworks**:
   - The teacher will want you to summarize homeworks effectively.
   - A significant part of your success will depend on how you present and self-evaluate.

4. **Home Page, Blogs, and and Game**
   - Be prepared to Demo your personal Web Site.
   - Show your key accomplishments through trimeseter.
