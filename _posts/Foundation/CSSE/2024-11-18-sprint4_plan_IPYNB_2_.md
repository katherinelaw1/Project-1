### Platformer Game Coding

As teams of 3 we will all be working on the same Platformer Game. We will be adding or extending levels in the game. 

- Each team will make a fork of [platformer4x](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/platformer4x).

- Each team of 3 will own, update, and customize a game level.

- Each team will complete pull requests to platformer4x and present a review

- Each team will change how the game ends.

- Each team will prepare a final review.

- Each individual will prepare final review on how they planned, coded, and prepared for live reviews during Sprint 4. They should have a page in personal blog that captures what they learned, studied, and changed in this sprint.  This includes process steps, style changes, coding, commits, and mistakes.  Try to highlight 3 to 5 things and be reflective.
