## Final Project

This Final Project needs to show that you have been introduced to Computer Science, JavaScript, and Object-Oriented Programming. This project prepares students to learn coding and explore future computer science and engineering courses. It demonstrates that the student has acquired some programming fundamentals.

By building a game, the project uses a topic of personal and social relevance (gaming) to investigate the impacts of computing through exploring language basics.

- **Software Engineering Practices**: Planning changes, checklists, burndowns, coding with comments, building help documentation, presentations
- **Control Structures**: Iteration, conditions, nested conditions
- **Data Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, JSON objects
- **Input/Output**: HTML5 input, validation, Document Object Model (DOM)
- **Operators**: String operations, mathematical operations, boolean expressions 
- **Classes**: Writing classes, creating methods, instantiating objects, using objects, calling methods, parameters, return values, basic inheritance
- **Software Development Lifecycle Practices**: Source control, forking, branching, building, testing and verification, pull requests, merging, deployment
- **Retrospective Engineering Practices**: Demos, live reviews, revising plans

### Mira Costa College

The final project and course are intended to build up skills that qualify the student for college credit.

Web Site for [CS111](https://catalog.miracosta.edu/disciplines/computerscience/#courseinventory).  Though, this course substitutes JavaScript for Java, which has been approved by advisory as substitute.

For those that wish to pursue Computer Science this starts you on [Math and CS Pathway](https://surf.miracosta.edu/psc/ps/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/MCC_CUSTOM.MZ_ACAD_MAP_SS.GBL?MAP_ID=1167)


## Schedule

The Final Project will be 6 weeks in duration (Weeks 19 to 24 of the CSSE course). The Final Project substitutes for a final exam and will have strict requirements.

## Project Planning Schedule

These weeks are preparatory for the project. During these weeks, you will describe your project expertise and plans, including expected goals and stretch goals.

**Week 17** - Help system that provides guidance to current and future engineers working on the game.

**Week 18** - Help System reviews.
- Planned changes to expertise topics that will impact others in the game.
- Planned changes to team level(s).
- Students start 12 hours of coding journal in their blog.
- **Friday**: Teacher review of the Help System.

## Project Development Schedule

These weeks are focused on development. During development, you should have one milestone to integrate, continuing the iterative cycle of development.

**Week 19** - Key Development Week. Commence on the hardest part of your project.
- 4 hours of coding and testing with the team.
- Commit and issue analytics and issue burndown are used to evaluate progress.

**Week 20** - Checkpoint Week. Commits and burndown.
- 2 hours of coding and testing with the team.
- **Wednesday**: Teacher review of analytics.
- 2 hours of testing, integration, and pull requests with Scrum Masters.

**Week 21** - Integration 1 Week. 1st integration and retrospective.
- 1 hour of retrospective planning.
- **Wednesday**: Teacher demo of running code on Production.
