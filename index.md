WELCOME TO MY BLOG!
Hi my name is Katherine Law.
Here is a little bit about me!
I like to spend time outdoors running, walking my dog or spending time with my friends. 
I have one dog and his name is Fifi! He is a mini white golden doodle and we got him 3 years ago. He's very social and very cute. 
A little bit more about me... I'm 14 years old and i'm chinese. My dad was born and raised in China and my mom was born and raised in vietnam for a while before she moved to the US. Even though i'm fully chinese, we do celebrate some vietnamese traditions that my mom celebrated back in Vietnam.
It seems so cool to be born outside of America but I love California and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I love the beaches, the always sunny weather (even in the winter!) and all of my family and friends here that I wouldn't want to leave and move away from.
Thank you so much for learning a little bit about me!!
