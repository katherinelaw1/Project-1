WELCOME TO MY BLOG!
Hi my name is Katherine Law.
Here is a little bit about me!
I like to spend time outdoors running, walking my dog or spending time with my friends. 
I have one dog and his name is Fifi! He is a mini white golden doodle and we got him 3 years ago. He's very social and very cute. 
A little bit more about me... I'm 14 years old and i'm chinese. My Dad was born and raised in China and my mom was born and raised in vietnam for a while before she moved to the us. Even though i'm fully chinese, we do celebrate some vietnamese traditions that my mom celebrated back in Vietnam.
