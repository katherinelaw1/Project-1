### Game Objectives:
The level starts by Rachit going to Disneyland, Finding a small kid pulling out the sword in the stone. Then he trys pulling the sword but it wouldn't move AT ALL. This motivates him to become buffed and come back to pull out the sword. 

The strength that he needs in order to pass the game is 800 lb worth full body pulling strength.
