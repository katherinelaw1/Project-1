# Hello! My name is Katherine Law.
I was born and raised in San Diego California my whole life. But I love to travel outside of California and see other parts of the world. The world is so much bigger than we know! My Dad has been taking our family to travel ever since I was very little. And we've gone to many different countries and cities all around the world. By far my favorite place to travel to is Hong Kong since I am able to visit my cousins that live there. I also love the very different atmosphere over there compared to America. I am chinese and it is cool to be surrounded amd immersed in my culture when travling to Hong Kong.
